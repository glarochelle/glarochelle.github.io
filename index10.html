  <h1> About Me</h1>
  <P>Hello, My name is Gabrielle Larochelle and welcome to my website! Here you will find everything and anything that interests me, from my traveling experiences, to my journalism articles! I even talk about my experiences living partially as a vegetarian (and how to make your vegetarian dishes actually delicious). This website embodies who I am, and what I enjoy and I hope you all enjoy everything I write down as well :).</P>
  <p>Love, Gabby</p>
